# Learning Game Engines : GraphicsProject_01

**Standard**: C++11

**Requires**: GLFW / GLEW and OpenGL driver (should be present with video card)

## Description:

Basically this will be the dumping ground of my learning how OpenGL and the graphics pipeline operates.
I initially was following https://learnopengl.com/, adding my own pieces as I went, it then became the core for my graphics programming final assignment. Now the project is over I intend to revisit the program when I have spare time and slowly refactor the code into something closer to a professional game engine. 

I expect this will be revised often and will have many bad design decisions.
