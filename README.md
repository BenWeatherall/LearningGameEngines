# GraphicsProject_01

**Standard**: C++11

**Requires**: GLFW / GLEW and OpenGL driver (should be present with video card)

## Description:

Basically this will be the dumping ground of my learning how OpenGL and the graphics pipeline operates.
I will be following https://learnopengl.com/ and adding my own pieces as I go. 

Then I'll be completely rewriting them as I realise my assumptions were incorrect!
